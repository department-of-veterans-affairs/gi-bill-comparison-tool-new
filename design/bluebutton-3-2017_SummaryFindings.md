## Blue Button testing
We tested [a prototype of downloading medical records](https://marvelapp.com/3gadi6d/screen/25002814) in feedback sessions that focused on account creation and [appeals status](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Appeals%20Status/Discovery/ConversationGuide2_4-17-17.md).

## Goals
- Test assumption that MHV branding on the downloaded health records would be jarring/confusing to veterans.
- Test assumption that "blue button" is confusing for new account creators.
- Is the MHV and Blue Button branding confusing or jarring?

## Findings

#### Downloading medical records 
- The loading circle was unclear, especially without animation. Since loading updates is a large part of the process, the team will try a more basic progress bar instead.
- Most participants did not notice that their medical records were created and served by another VA website than the one they were on.
  - Some participants had knowledge of different VA websites, and were not rattled by the information coming from the new site.
  - When the change was pointed out, some Veterans said they’d like to be warned about changing sites, but weren’t unhappy since they could see their medical records.
- The overall flow seems improved from the last round; seeing a form with options, then waiting for an update, then seeing a download made sense to participants.

#### Additional topics
- Consent and third party permissions remain challenging; trust is often low for those type of connections
